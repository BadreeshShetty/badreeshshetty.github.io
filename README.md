### Data Analysis comparing GDP, GDP/Capita, Population IMF Data of 196 countries with SP 500/Russell 3000 Data
[Website](https://badreeshshetty-gdp-ceo-check-app-xxsa6n.streamlit.app/) and [Github](https://github.com/BadreeshShetty/GDP-CEO-Check)
- Conducted a comprehensive data analysis of GDP, GDP per capita, and population statistics from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for 196 countries, comparing them with data from the S&P 500 and Russell 3000 indices. Using this analysis, Developed a web application that provides a user-friendly interface to showcase key comparisons between countries and companies, along with their respective attributes.
